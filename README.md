This bot finds the closest connections between the two specified profiles on the VK social network at a distance of three handshakes. It looks like a list of mutual friends or those friends of the target profile who have mutual friends with the first profile.
This can be helpful in finding people or social research.
The program is expressed in a simple dialogue where the user enters two VK accounts one by one and then gets the answer.
